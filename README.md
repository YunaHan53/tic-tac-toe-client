## Planning Story

For the Tic-Tac-Toe game, I planned out what I want my page layout to look like by drawing out the wireframes. I wanted to have one webpage with sign-up and sign-in forms on the homepage, and upon signing in, the player then can choose to change their password, start new game and sign out if they choose. Upon clicking on the new game, the gameboard will show up and the player can click on any box in the gameboard to make the first move. The first player will always be 'X' and the second player will always be 'O'. Upon getting three 'X's or three 'O's in a row, the game will display who won with the option to reset.
